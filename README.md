# -Software-Quality-Prediction-Project-for-Uni-Course-CSE422
This project was developed for my CSE422 Artificial Intelligence course. It focuses on predicting the quality of software modules using AI techniques.

🔍 Overview

The goal is to classify software modules as defective or non-defective using machine learning models. This helps in early detection of potential software issues.

🧪 Models Used

Decision Tree

Logistic Regression

Neural Network (MLP & Keras)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Matplotlib, Seaborn
